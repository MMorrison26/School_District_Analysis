# School District Analysis
## *Overview*
The Chief Data Scientist for a city school district, Maria, needs to analyze the standardized testing results in the district as an overview and to identify any trends. The School Board and Superintendent would also like a breakdown on school funding among the district. After hearing of potential cheating or inaccrate data, they also requested a synopsis showing how the data would be affected if we specifically removed scores from the 9th graders at Thomas High School. They will use all of this analysis to make decisions regarding the upcoming school year moving forward. 
## *Results*
Based upon our results before and after removing Thomas HS 9th graders, here is what we found:
* Given the size of the data, the swap in THS scores hardly affected the overall district summary - just slightly higher.
* The school summary is pretty telling because Thomas High School goes from only 65% passing up to 91% passing overall.
* Replacing the 9th graders' math/reading scores brings Thomas HS up in the overall rankings.
* Replacing the 9th graders' scores affects the following:
  * Scores by grade: 9th graders increased scores overall, but 10th-12th grade was not affected
  * Scores by school spending: this slightly affected the $630-$644 bucket (which THS was in)
  * Scores by school size: Again, the Medium schools (where THS was) were affected positively
  * Scores by school type: Because this was so aggregated, the Charter school type was only slightly affected
